## Contribution Rules ðŸ“š:

- Pull requests that break the rules are allowed; we'll merge them anyway ;)
- Do NOT add any build steps (e.g., npm install); let's keep this a simple static site.
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling and code can be pretty, ugly, or even silly, as long as it works.
- Don't forget to add your name to the `contributorsList` file.
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
